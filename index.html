		    <h6>DFW Board Games is proud to announce Dallas Games Marathon (DGM) has a new location.</h6>

 
<p>New Location: 
	<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/f8NLRE9UntxrejX9A"> 910 West Parker Road Suite #380 Plano, TX 75075</a>

	    </p>

 
<p>
That is right around the corner and across the parking lot from the old address.
We have identified this location as the best choice after months of searching for a suitable venue.
With nearly 4500 sq. ft., we can accommodate gaming community events that have space requirements not readily met by other locations.
	    </p>
<p>	    
Our new location will afford our members the following benefits:
	    </p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Expanded Event Schedule</li>
		<li>Private Rooms</li>
    		<li>Larger Library</li>
    		<li>Additional Events</li>
	</ul>
	    </p>
<p>	    
While we are remodeling the space, we wanted everyone to know you have a place to play.
We plan a soft opening this week (Thursday starting at 4PM) featuring quick tours and highlighting our amenities.
Next week, we intend to move the library, tables, chairs, etc. and start scheduled gaming events.
Our official Grand Opening event will be starting Sept. 22nd, 2022, and last thru the weekend.
I intend to be there from 2-10PM most days this month, drop us a message if you are heading over.
	    </p>
<p>	    
Additional announcements will be forthcoming, as well as a consolidated set of answers to anticipated questions.
<p>
Thank you,
</p>
<p>
