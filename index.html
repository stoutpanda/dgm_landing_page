    <h6>After 12 years and 134 Dallas Games Marathon events, we have sadly had to shut down on July 31st, 2020 due to the pandemic. We have closed our event center facility and have placed the library, tables and chairs in storage for now in hopes of quickly reopening in the future. We hope to reopen see you all again! </h6>
